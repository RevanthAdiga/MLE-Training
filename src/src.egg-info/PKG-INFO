# Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:

Create the environment from the env.yml file:
 - conda env create -f env.yml
 - conda activate env

# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data.

The following techniques have been used:

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest
 - SVR

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## To excute the script
